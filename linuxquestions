Look up commands

Notes cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory

List examples with documentation with

Absolute path : specifying the location of a file from the root directory, best used if moving from any location. Always starts at beginning of hard drive

ALSO realpath helps to show the absolute path of any file

Ex- cd /home/user/Documents

Relative path : helps to be more efficient to not completely start from the beginning of the hard drive and rather it uses

.. represents moving to a parent directory so if something is in a different directory it moves up to the parent directory and moves to the corresponding directory

“../bar/file.txt means to move up one directory (into /var/log) and then descend into /var/log/bar, which contains file.txt.”

A special directory symbol (. for current directory, .. for parent directory)

If you use ls . you list the things in current directory, but if you use ls .. you are able to list from the parent directory without actually being in it

Works with cd too, cd .. to move to parent directory of current one

A tilde (~) always references back to the home directory

Example: ~/Documents translates to /home/kali/Documents
